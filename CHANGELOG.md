## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Admin dashboard** (`app/admin/page.tsx`) converted to Server Component — data fetched server-side via `createServerSupabaseClient()`. Interactive parts (checkout button, checked-in list, charts) extracted to `components/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx` client island.
- **Admin reports** (`app/admin/reports/page.tsx`) converted to Server Component. Stat cards and chart data passed to `components/admin/AdminReportsClient.tsx` client island.
- **Member home** (`app/member/page.tsx`) converted to Server Component — `member_home_stats` and `kiosk_get_checked_in` fetched server-side. Calendar, streak banner, and stat cards extracted to `components/member/MemberHomeClient.tsx`.
- **Member leaderboard** (`app/member/leaderboard/page.tsx`) converted to Server Component — default `workouts` category pre-fetched. Category tab switching and in-memory cache live in `components/member/LeaderboardClient.tsx`.
- **Kiosk** (`app/kiosk/page.tsx`) upgraded with Supabase Realtime subscription on `attendance` table (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`) for instant refresh; poll interval relaxed 30s → 60s as fallback.
- **Revalidation endpoint** (`app/api/admin/revalidate-gym/route.ts`) extended with `gym-stats-${gymId}`, `gym-reports-${gymId}`, and `leaderboard-${gymId}` tags.

### Added
- `components/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx` — client island for admin dashboard interactivity.
- `components/admin/AdminReportsClient.tsx` — client island for reports charts and stat display.
- `components/member/MemberHomeClient.tsx` — client island for member home with attendance calendar.
- `components/member/LeaderboardClient.tsx` — client island for leaderboard category switching.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Migration baseline** — `supabase/migrations/001_production_baseline.sql`: single idempotent file that reproduces the full production schema. Old draft migrations 001–004 archived.
- **Strict TypeScript** — `ignoreBuildErrors` flipped to `false`; all RPC Json casts typed explicitly.
- **Regenerated DB types** — `lib/database.types.ts` generated from live Supabase schema (not hand-maintained).
- **Performance** — Landing page images converted to WebP/WebM; chart components extracted; layout refactored.
- **Auth** — Improved logout routing; fixed cache-miss on new gyms.
- **Tests** — Integration and unit test coverage for gym auth flow, gym finder section, login-origin, and sign-out routing.
- **CLAUDE.md** — Developer guide: DB workflow rule, stack overview, migration structure, auth helpers, type safety conventions.
- **Versioning** — Semantic versioning, CHANGELOG, and auto-release GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed
- `next.config.mjs`: `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` → `false`.
- `lib/gym-public.ts`: exported `GymPublicData` type; fixed spread type error on RPC result.
- `app/admin/page.tsx`: fixed `admin_dashboard_stats` Json cast; fetch `kiosk_get_checked_in` separately.
- `app/admin/reports/page.tsx`: fixed `admin_reports_data` Json cast.
- `app/member/page.tsx`: fixed `member_home_stats` Json cast.
- `app/signup/member/page.tsx`: fixed `get_gym_by_code` Json cast.

### Fixed
- Removed spurious UTF-16 `database.types.ts` from repo root (broke ESLint).
- Removed committed binaries (`repomix-output.xml`, `b_*.zip`) from `.gitignore`.
